## 🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Risk:** One school accessing another school's student data

**Requirements:**
- ✅ **School-level isolation** - Data must be segregated by school
- ✅ **Tenant validation** - Every request must verify school context
- ✅ **Database row-level security** - Queries filtered by school_id
- ✅ **Cross-tenant access prevention** - Hard boundaries between schools

**Implementation:**
```python
# app/services/tenant_isolation.py
class TenantIsolationService:
    """
    Ensures data isolation between schools (tenants).
    """
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_user_school_id(user_id: str) -> str:
        """Get the school_id for a user."""
        # Query user's school assignment
        # CRITICAL: Users can only belong to one school
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def verify_school_access(
        user_id: str,
        requested_school_id: Optional[str],
        student_id: Optional[str],
        classroom_id: Optional[str]
    ) -> str:
        """
        Verify user can access requested school's data.
        Returns the validated school_id.
        
        Raises:
            HTTPException: If user tries to access different school's data
        """
        user_school_id = TenantIsolationService.get_user_school_id(user_id)
        
        # If student_id provided, verify it belongs to user's school
        if student_id:
            student_school = get_student_school(student_id)
            if student_school != user_school_id:
                raise HTTPException(
                    403,
                    detail="Access denied: Student belongs to different school"
                )
        
        # If classroom_id provided, verify it belongs to user's school
        if classroom_id:
            classroom_school = get_classroom_school(classroom_id)
            if classroom_school != user_school_id:
                raise HTTPException(
                    403,
                    detail="Access denied: Classroom belongs to different school"
                )
        
        # Always return user's school_id (never allow cross-tenant access)
        return user_school_id
    
    @staticmethod
    def apply_school_filter(
        query: Any,
        school_id: str,
        table_name: str
    ) -> Any:
        """
        Apply school_id filter to database queries.
        
        CRITICAL: All queries must include school_id filter.
        """
        # Ensure query includes school_id filter
        # Never allow queries without school context
        return query.filter(table_name.school_id == school_id)
```

**Database Schema Requirements:**
- All assessment tables must have `school_id` column

                "unicef": True,
                "gdpr": True if is_eu_school(school_id) else False,
                "coppa": True if grade_level < 13 else False
            }
        }
        
        # Write to audit log (immutable storage recommended)
        write_audit_log(audit_entry)
        
        # Also log to structured logging system
        logger.info(

- School_id must be verified on every request
- Database queries must always filter by school_id

### **User Management:**
- Educators belong to one school
- Admins may need cross-school access (but logged/audited)
- School-specific roles (school admin, educator, etc.)

### **Compliance:**
- Individual agreements with each school
- School-specific data retention policies (if needed)
- School notification preferences (for breaches)
